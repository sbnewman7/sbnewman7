### Hi there, I'm new! ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on relearning everything I ever knew about coding, plus some.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning about source control using GitHub. Woo hoo!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborating on programs that will change the world! Or at least earn an income.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about where to get a good iced chai latte with homemade boba in Crested Butte. Extra spicy!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I wish I had an extra spicy iced latte right now. :)

This is my âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository `README.md` that tells all of GitHub about ME.

YIKES!!!
